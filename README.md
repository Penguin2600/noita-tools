# noita-tools

A web app for finding LC and AP values for a given seed

The code for finding LC and AP values was transferred from [noita_unicorn](https://github.com/SaphireLattice/noita_unicorn)'s `Program.cs` from c# to typescript using [Bridge.NET](https://github.com/bridgedotnet/Bridge/)

Also, I will be taking inspiration from [cr4xy](https://cr4xy.dev/noita/) for extra features
